# Installation

Change directory to the folder where you downloaded the zip:

```
cd {folder} 
```

Unzip file and enter folder:

``` 
unzip LigandMapper.py-main.zip

cd LigandMapper.py-main
```

And run:

```
python3 installMe.py 
```

During the installation you will be prompted to enter the password for sudo because the file needs to create a link in the /usr/bin/ folder.
