# Requirements

OS: Linux or Mac

This is a standalone package, however it requires python3 and java to run. 

#### Python3 check:
```
python3 --version
```
Should return something like: 
```
Python 3.x.y
```
(otherwise you will need to install it)

#### Java check:
```
java --version
```
Should return something like: 
```
openjdk 11.0.18 2023-01-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.18+10-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.18+10-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```
(otherwise you will need to install it)

# Installation of LignadMapper.py

Once you have python3 and java on your machine, clone the repository or download it on your computer.

Change directory to the folder where you downloaded the zip:

```
cd {folder} 
```

Unzip file and enter folder:

``` 
unzip LigandMapper.py-main.zip

cd LigandMapper.py-main
```

And run:

```
python3 installMe.py 
```

During the installation you will be prompted to enter the password for sudo because the file needs to create a link in the /usr/bin/ folder.

After a successful installation you can remove the zip and the LigandMapper.py-main.zip directory.
